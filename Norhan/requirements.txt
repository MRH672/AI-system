# Norhan AI Agent Requirements
# Basic Python packages needed for the AI agent

# No external dependencies required!
# This agent uses only Python standard library modules:
# - json (for memory storage)
# - datetime (for time/date responses)
# - random (for varied responses)
# - os (for file operations)
# - typing (for type hints)

# Optional packages for enhanced functionality:
# requests>=2.25.1          # For web API integration (if needed)
# python-dateutil>=2.8.2   # For advanced date handling (if needed)
# colorama>=0.4.4           # For colored terminal output (if needed)

# To install optional packages (if needed later):
# pip install requests python-dateutil colorama

# Note: The basic agent works without any external dependencies
# All functionality is built using Python standard library only
